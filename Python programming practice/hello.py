# you want to find out how much it will cost you to travel from lahore to karachi by car. The expenses 
# include the toll fee plus the fuel cost over the distance of 1242 KM. Suppose that you car gives you
# an average of 13.7km/liter over the journey and the toll expense is estimated to be at 1500 PKR.
# Keeping in mind the current fuel rate of 332.24PKR/liter. Find the total cost.
# Ask the distance and the toll expense from the user so your program can be used to calculate the
# travel cost for any distance. Note that fuel rate and mileage shall be boh constants in all the 
# case.

#this is the program when we asks 4 things from user kay vo input kary

# dist=int(input("enter your distance:"))
# toll_exp=int(input("enter your toll expense"))
# Car_Avg=float(input("enter you car mileage:"))
# F_rate=float(input("Enter your fuel rate:"))

# Cost=dist/Car_Avg*F_rate+toll_exp
# print("your total cost from lahore to karachi is:",round(Cost))

#part_1 of this program

# dist=1242
# Car_Avg=13.7
# toll_Exp=1500
# fuel_rate=332.24
# cost=dist/Car_Avg*fuel_rate+toll_Exp
# print("your Total Cost from Lahore to karachi:",cost)

#part_2 of this program is 

# Car_Avg=13.7
# fuel_rate=332.24
# dist=int(input("Enter your distance:"))
# toll_Exp=int(input("enter your toll expense:"))
# cost=dist/Car_Avg*fuel_rate+toll_Exp
