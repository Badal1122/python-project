# for loop ko samjhny kay liy kuch question karny pary gay us kay bagir samjh nae ay gae.. without prastice you can do nothing 
# and with practice on daily base you can do everything in programming 

# #Single parameter 
# range(5)
# start=0
# condition<5
# iteration=1

# for i in range(5):
#     print(i)

#double parameter
#range(0,5)
#start=0
#condition<5
#iteration=1

# i=int(input("enter a number that you want to ask in:-"))
# for i in range(i,5):
#     print(i)

# for i in range(1,5):
#     print(i)
# print(i)

#triple parameter
#range(1,10,-1)
#start=0
#condition<10
#increment and decrement in for loop 


# for i in range(4,1,-1):
#     print(i)
# #this program is for decrement 


# for i in range(1,6,1):
#     print(i)
# this program is for increment 


# j=3
# for i in range(1,11):
#     sum=j*i
#     print(j, " x ", i, " = ",sum) 
# #i will make table in for loop without declaring variable that is easy but demands prastice


#here i will create a table with declaring variable that is tuff but i will manage it

# i=int(input("enter your table:-"))
# j=int(input("enter your number:-"))
# for j in range(j,11):
#     print(i, " x ", j, " = ", i*j)

#here i will create a table in descending order by using for loop that is not tuff for you, if you can practice it

# i=int(input("enter your table:-"))
# j=int(input("enter your value:-"))
# for j in range(11,j,-1):
#     print(i, " x ", j, " = ",i*j)

#practice makes a man perfect but if you can practice daily then you will become successful, otherwise you are not successful in your life.
#and wait for a write time, and time is over, then people says
#i is not use to cry over split milk
